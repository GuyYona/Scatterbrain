**ScatterBrain** (Version 1.0) is a MATLAB application developed by Guy Yona (Technion – Israel Institute of Technology) that calculates and visualizes the relative light intensity in a 3D turbid medium (e.g., brain tissue) illuminated from the surface by an optical fiber, using a modified Beam Spread Function (BSF) analytical model.

## Features

- Analytical + numerical BSF model for light scattering in 3D media  
- Configurable fiber geometry (radius, NA) and optical coefficients  
- Interactive App-style GUI in MATLAB  
- Cross-section visualization with overlaid Point Of Interest (POI)  
- Outputs both volumetric and axial intensity data
